Example for NA server woot aw yiss

p = profit per transaction
t = transactions
l = proportion dropped due to numbah of transactions
s = proportion dropped due to switchin teh servahs
c = cost for server
n = numbah of serverz


((p*t) + sEU(p*tFROMEU) +sAP(p*tFROMAP))l  + HOWEVERMANYSERVERSINNODESAMETHING... -c*nNA  THENYOUMOTHERFUCKINGREPEATBUTFOREUANDAP

compared to

((p*t) + sEU(p*tFROMEU) +sAP(p*tFROMAP))l  + HOWEVERMANYSERVERSINNODESAMETHING... -c*(nNA + 1) THENSAMETHINGONLYNOT n+1

compared to

MOVE SOME OF THOSE LAZY ASS TRANSACTIONS OVER TO SOME EU SERVERS

compared to

MOVE SOME OF THOSE LAZY ASS TRANSACTIONS OVER TO A NEW EU SERVER YOU MADE HOLY SHIT nEU + 1

compared to

MOVE SOME OF THOSE LAZY ASS TRANSACTIONS OVER TO SOME AP SERVERS THIS TIME

compared to

OH FUCK MOVE SOME OF THOSE LAZY ASS TRANSACTIONS OVER TO A NEW AP SERVER YOU MADE nAP + 1

AND THEN YOU DECIDE WHAT TO DO. FORGET ABOUT SHUTTING DOWN SERVERS. ALL THE SERVERS OPEN FOREVER. FOREVERRRRR AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA YEAH.

THIS IS GOING TO BE ANNOYING AS FUCK TO CODE.
AND THIS DOESN'T EVEN HANDLE HOW TO BALANCE TRANSACTIONS INTO SERVERS IN AN AREA OH HELL NO.

EXCEPT NOW IT SORTA DOES- OBSERVE:
For all the servers in an area (ex NA) take transactions -> check if adding will make it go over capacity.
If not, then add it to the server B-EAC)(!
If it will, then fill it to just under, then move the rest over to another server.
if all them servers aint up to ship go to what we was doing up top you feel me?


java tier- it's like god tier, only more like what's above at the top.

DaTaBaSe TiEr: 

same decision handling for individual servers in an area (ex NA)
but for the motherfuckin other things...
 
To SeE iF yOu ShOuLd OpEn Up TwO mOtHeRfUcKiN sErVeRs (starting from 1 open cuz shit man):
q = efficiency for multiple servers

((p*t) + sEU(p*tFROMEU) +sAP(p*tFROMAP))l  + HOWEVERMANYSERVERSINNODESAMETHING... -c*(nNA) IF SET UP IN NA,

compared to
((p*t) + sEU(p*tFROMEU) +sAP(p*tFROMAP))l  + HOWEVERMANYSERVERSINNODESAMETHING... -c*(nNA + 1)

compared to

[((p*t) + sEU(p*tFROMEU) +sAP(p*tFROMAP))l  + HOWEVERMANYSERVERSINNODESAMETHING... -c*(nNA + 1) + SAME FOR ANOTHER SERVER ]*q
