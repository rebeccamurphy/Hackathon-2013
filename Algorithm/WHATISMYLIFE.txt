Example for NA server

profitTrans = profit per transaction
numTrans = transactions
proportionNumTrans = proportion dropped due to numbah of transactions
proportionSwitch = proportion dropped due to switchin the servers
serverCost = cost for server
numServers = number of servers


((profitTrans * numTrans) + proportionSwitchEU(profitTrans*numTransFROMEU) + proportionSwitchAP(profitTrans*numTransFROMAP))proportionNumTrans
 + for each server in the region since the number of people is different... - serverCost * numServersNA  +(Same process, only for EU and AP servers)

compared to:

((profitTrans*numTrans) + proportionSwitchEU(profitTrans*numTransFROMEU) + proportionSwitchAP(profitTrans*numTransFROMAP))lossNumTrans 
 + for each server in the region since the number of people is different... - serverCost * (numServersNA + 1) + (Same procces, only do not do numServers+1)

compared to:

//EU servers: except here you have the transferes from NA to handle

((profitTrans * numTrans) + proportionSwitchEU(profitTrans*numTransFROMEU) + proportionSwitchAP(profitTrans*numTransFROMAP))proportionNumTrans
 + for each server in the region since the number of people is different... - serverCost * (numServersEU)
 

compared to: : except here you have the transferes from NA to handle

//AP servers

((profitTrans * numTrans) + proportionSwitchEU(profitTrans*numTransFROMEU) + proportionSwitchAP(profitTrans*numTransFROMAP))proportionNumTrans
 + for each server in the region since the number of people is different... - serverCost * (numServersAp) //only beneficial for java
