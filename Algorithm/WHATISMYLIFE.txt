Example for NA server woot aw yiss

profitTrans = profit per transaction
numTrans = transactions
proportionNumTrans = proportion dropped due to numbah of transactions
proportionSwitch = proportion dropped due to switchin teh servahs
serverCost = cost for server
numServers = numbah of serverz


((profitTrans * numTrans) + proportionSwitchEU(profitTrans*numTransFROMEU) + proportionSwitchAP(profitTrans*numTransFROMAP))proportionNumTrans
 + for each server in the region since the number of people is different... - serverCost * numServersNA  THEN YOU MOTHERFUCKING REPEAT BUT FOR EU AND AP

>

((profitTrans*numTrans) + proportionSwitchEU(profitTrans*numTransFROMEU) + proportionSwitchAP(profitTrans*numTransFROMAP))lossNumTrans 
 + for each server in the region since the number of people is different... - serverCost * (numServersNA + 1) THEN SAME THING ONLY NOT n+1

compared to

((profitTrans * numTrans) + proportionSwitchEU(profitTrans*numTransFROMEU) + proportionSwitchAP(profitTrans*numTransFROMAP))proportionNumTrans
 + for each server in the region since the number of people is different... - serverCost * (numServersEU + 1)
 


MOVE SOME OF THOSE LAZY ASS TRANSACTIONS OVER TO SOME EU SERVERS

compared to

MOVE SOME OF THOSE LAZY ASS TRANSACTIONS OVER TO SOME AP SERVERS THIS TIME
((profitTrans * numTrans) + proportionSwitchEU(profitTrans*numTransFROMEU) + proportionSwitchAP(profitTrans*numTransFROMAP))proportionNumTrans
 + for each server in the region since the number of people is different... - serverCost * (numServersAp + 1) //only beneficial for java
 
AND THEN YOU DECIDE WHAT TO DO. FORGET ABOUT SHUTTING DOWN SERVERS. ALL THE SERVERS OPEN FOREVER. FOREVERRRRR AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA YEAH.

THIS IS GOING TO BE ANNOYING AS FUCK TO CODE.
AND THIS DOESN'T EVEN HANDLE HOW TO BALANCE TRANSACTIONS INTO SERVERS IN AN AREA OH )(-ELL NO.

EXCEPT NOW IT SORTA DOES- OBSERVE:
For all the servers in an area (ex NA) take transactions -> check if adding will make it go over capacity.
If not, then add it to the server B-EAC)(!
If it will, then fill it to just under, then move the rest over to another server.
if all them servers aint up to ship go to what we was doing up top you feel me?


java tier- it's like god tier, only more like what's above at the top.
