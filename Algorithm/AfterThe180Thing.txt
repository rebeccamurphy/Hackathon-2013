//This doesn't do price handling yet, it's sorting what goes where when moving stuff over to servers.

So there is X transactions left in region R(1) (for example). Other two regions = R(2), R(3)  1 = NA, 2 = EU and 3 = AP in array
You change whether you're using R(1), R(2), R(3)
S(i) = A server in an R


profitTrans = profit per transaction
numTrans = transactions separate from X
proportionNumTrans = proportion not dropped due to numbah of transactions
proportionSwitch = proportion not dropped due to switchin teh servahs
serverCost = cost for server
numServers = numbah of serverz

i = 1	

if (R(2).S(i).numTrans + X < 180){
	
	R(2).S(i).numTrans = R(2).S(i).numTrans + X;
	X = 0;
	BREAK OUT OF LOOP
}
else {

	if (i <> R(2).numServers){
			
		for (j = i+1, j <=R(2).numServers, j++)
	{

		if (R(2).S(j).numTrans + X < 180) then{
			S(j).t = S(j).t + X;
			X = 0;
			BREAK OUT OF LOOP
		}
		
		}
			
	}else{
	
		for (i, i<=R(2).numServers, i++){
	
			L = (R(2).S(i).numTrans + X - 200)  //how many transfers left over
			R(2).S(i).numTrans = R(2)S(i).numTrans + X - L
			X = L
		
			if (X = 0) then{
				BREAK OUT OF LOOP
			}
		
		}
	}
	// NEEDS A WAY TO KEEP TRACK OF HOW MANY WERE TRANSFERED FROM R(1) TO R(2) FOR PRICE COMPARISONS LATER USING SOME PARTS OF WHATISMYLIFE CODE
	
	if (X != 0){
	
		i = 1	

		if (R(2).S(i).numTrans + X < 180){
		
			R(2).S(i).numTrans = R(2).S(i).numTrans + X;

			BREAK OUT OF LOOP
		}

					//THEN A NEW SERVER DEFINITITELY NEEDS TO ME MADE I'M PRETTY SURE, EVERYWHERE IS PRETTY DAMN FULL
			}
		}

	}
}

//AND THEN THIS GETS COMPARED TO THE SAME THING, ONLY USE R(3) FIRST THEN R(2)

//THEN WE START DOING PRICE COMPARISION FOR R(1)-->R(2)-->R(3), R(1)-->R(3)-->R(2), AND MAKING A NEW SERVER IN R(1)
