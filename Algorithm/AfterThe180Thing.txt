//This doesn't do price handling yet, it's sorting what goes where when moving stuff over to servers.

So there are X transactions left in region R(1) (for example). Other two regions = R(2), R(3)  1 = NA, 2 = EU and 3 = AP in array
You change whether you're using R(1), R(2), R(3)
S(i) = A server in an R


profitTrans = profit per transaction
numTrans = transactions already in place, does not include X
proportionNumTrans = proportion not dropped due to numbah of transactions
proportionSwitch = proportion not dropped due to switchin teh servahs
serverCost = cost for server
numServers = numbah of serverz

i = 1	

if (R(2).S(i).numTrans + X < 180){						//checks the first server in the second region (EU) and checks if we can add the transitions
														//without exceeding 180

	X = 0;
	BREAK OUT OF LOOP
}

		for (j = i+1, j <= R(2).numServers, j++)		//start at the second server
	{

		}
	}
	// NEEDS A WAY TO KEEP TRACK OF HOW MANY WERE TRANSFERED FROM R(1) TO R(2) FOR PRICE COMPARISONS LATER USING SOME PARTS OF WHATISMYLIFE CODE
	
	if (X != 0){

			}
		}

	}
}

//AND THEN THIS GETS COMPARED TO THE SAME THING, ONLY USE R(3) FIRST THEN R(2)

//THEN WE START DOING PRICE COMPARISION FOR R(1)-->R(2)-->R(3), R(1)-->R(3)-->R(2), AND MAKING A NEW SERVER IN R(1)
