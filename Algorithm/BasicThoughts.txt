1) Distrubute across each individual region as best as possible.

2) Keep track of the number of transactions left over in each region over the 200 mark.
  R(1).X, R(2).X, R(3).X

3) if there is leftover transactions in all regions (No R.X = 0) then a new server has to be built

4) if there is room in a region but not in others, check to see how much you can distribute and get a price, similar to how we are doing now. compare that price to building a new server. 
	chose cheapest and impliment.
	
5) If there are unoccupied servers, check to see if traffic is going down. If it is, then remove the server.	

This should work for web tier and java tier.

5) For Database tier, we need to check to see if more traffic is trending in a location that is NOT the current region. If, so, we need to check to see if it would be more beneficial to
switch regions or impliment 2 regions.  If 2 databases are open, definitely check to see if it would be more beneficial to bring one of them down.
